<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br />
<br />
<h2>Why this website is ugly ?</h2><br />
The reason is very simple, the orpheus' developer is... a developer and not a web designer.<br />
If you're a webdesigner and you would like to propose a style, please contact me at contact[at]cartman34.fr .<br />
<br />
<h2>Why this website is (only) in english ?</h2><br />
Because English is an international language, this is the language used by developers to make it understandable by everyone, as the Orpheus framework.<br />
<br />
<h2>Is this website based on Orpheus ?</h2><br />
Yes, of course.<br />
This version is often up to date.<br />
<br />
<h2>How it works ? How can i get started ?</h2><br />
Dude, please read <a href="doc/html/">the manual of Orpheus</a>. ;-)<br />
<br />
<h2>Is it just another PHP framework ?</h2><br />
In fact, this is not really a framework, it's the future base of your website.<br />
It helps you to complete your work, without coding again the common base of a website.<br />
The main difference is that Orpheus forces you to follow certain basic rules, allowing you<br />
to maintain a secure and optimized application, even if it's designed to be tolerant and extensible.<br />
