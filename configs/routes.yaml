# 
# HTTP Route allows the following config:
# - path : The relative path to this route. Mandatory config.
# - method : Restrict path access to the given HTTP method.
# - controller : The controller to use to process this route
# - restrictTo : Restriction configuration for this route, you can customize accessibility, the common field is "role".
# - redirect : Redirect to the given URL, using RedirectController.
# - url_config : Redirect to the URL provided by the configurable url_config, using RedirectController & AppConfig. Require orpheus/orpheus-webtools.
# - render : The template to render this route, using StaticPageController. Processed as option.
# Other fields will be send as options to the controller, controller can access to all this configuration.
#
# Known roles: visitor, member, moderator, administrator, developer
